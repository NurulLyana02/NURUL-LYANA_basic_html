<h1>WHAT IS PUBLIC LIBRARY?</h1>
<p><i> Public libraries continue to be places for education and self-help  and offer opportunity for people of all ages and backgrounds.  
They offer opportunity for everyone to  learn and to pursue self-improvement. 
In response to community needs for information, many libraries offer such programs as English as a  Second Language (ESL) classes, homework help, 
after-school programs for children, job information centers, assistance for new immigrants, literacy programs, and much, much more. 
 To serve such community needs, public libraries collect and make available information in many, many formats.</p>

<p>For many children and adults, libraries are the only place to go use a computer or access the Internet. 
Libraries are places where people connect not just with books and computers but with other people.
They know how to find the best information in whatever form and teach others how to find, use, and evaluate information.
The library is one of the most valuable institutions we have, and  we should not take it for granted.

<p> Founded in 1944, Public Library Association is a member-driven organization that exists to provide a diverse program of communication,
 publication, advocacy, continuing education, and programming for its members and others interested
 in the advancement of public library service. </p>
